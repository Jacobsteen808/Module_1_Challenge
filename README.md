# Fintech and Investment Management: Blackrock inc.
## Overview and Origin
Blackrock, inc. is a finanicial services company founded in 1994 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Susan Wagner, and Ralph Schlosstein.
In 1994, Blackrock started as a fixed income asset management firm for instituational clients. However, as the company evolved so did the advisory services they offered to their customers. However, in 2009, Chairman and CEO, Larry Fink had the vision to create a global investment management company and become heavily involved in the Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) market. This was highlighted when Blackrock inc. acquired ishares, which was the largest ETF management firm of its time and still is responsible for roughly 37% of the worlds ETF assets. This made Blackrock the largest ETF investment management companies globally, with $9.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM). 
When Blackrock inc. first started, the porject was funded through founders private funds as well as investors who purchased company stock early in the companies lifecyle. As the company grew into the investment giant it has become today, it began to expand using funds acquired through client management fees. 
## Business Activities
Blackrock inc. was established in 1994 with the goal of providing institutional asset management for large companies. Managing institutional assets is no small task but Blackrock inc. had the idea that managing company risk with investment solutions which are streamlined by the client to be specific for their needs. Setting the tone that one large general portfolio isn't necessarily the best way to manage assets and that subaccounts were needed to address different investment needs such as different risk tolerances and investment objectives, i.e. growth, aggressive growth, income, stability. 
Blackrock inc. began as a fixed asset management company for institutional investors, managing bonds and other return yielding commercial and government papers. As the company grew, they began to offer more services and now manage individual investment accounts as well as offer personal financial advisory. Blackrock inc. is already the largest ETF servicer and has no minimum AUM to work with an advisor or invest in their products and is available to people globally.
Blackrock inc. uses a platform called Aladdin which specializes in risk analysis and helping Blackrock inc. optimize portfolios to match investor objectives. Performing investment and portfolio analysis faster and more efficient than any financial professional could, doing this cuts down costs on analysts and other supporting staff and allows for a more streamlined decision making process. Combining this technology with Blackrock's global pressence and expetise across various asset classes, its no wonder they've become the largest player in the investments world.
Blackrock's largest competitors, Fidelity investments and Vanguard capital, try to keep up by providing low-cost investment products, ETFs, and various kinds of AI, i.e. robo-advisors, to enhance customer experience and create a more user friendly and accessible way to invest. Although it may seem to be a daunting task, the emergence of AI and its utilization has proven to keep these companies in the race with the investment giant, Blackrock. 
## Landscape
Blackrock inc. is spread across several different domains. These domains include; fintech through the use of AI, asset management of ETFs and personal or institutional investor portfolio, wealth management through financial advisors addressing personal wholistic financial planning, and alternative investing through hedge funds and other altfin strategies.
One way that Blackrock's fintech domain has changed over the last 5-10 years has been the development of AI and machine learning. These technologies have been used to detect fraud on customer accounts, run investment and portfoilo analysis, check customer credit, and creating robo-advisors to help guide clients through their investment needs without a finanical professional being involved. 
Other major companies such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Northwestern Mutual, and J.P. Morgan have been utilizing these technologies to provide competition in this field. For example, companies such as Northwestern Mutual use robo-advisors to not only guide a prospective client through the onboarding process creating a truly one of a kind financial plan for them, but also remaining accessible at all hours of the day for those clients that may feel more involved than others. 
## Results
Fintech has helped Blackrock cut costs to provide less of a fee for customers looking to invest with the company. effecting nearly every department the company has under its umbrella, the use of AI and other analysis tools has cut costs because of its automated nature. Automating every repeatitive tasks or processes, such as trade execution and running reports has cut customer costs by $30 billion putting 13% of Blackrock's portfolio managers out of work. In comparison to its competitors, this number is quite large but scales with company size to save similar amounts of money.
## Recommedations
Although Blackrock is the largest asset management company in the world, they lack the ability to provide comprehensive personal and business financial planning. Being an industry leader in two of the three parts to comprehenisve planning, optimizing and growth, Blackrock overlooks the ability to protect its clients and their families from lifes uncertainties. Life insurance is a key piece to financial planning and can offer large sums of tax free dollars, whole life insurance, to accrue in a cash value account to be used by the policyholder to reduce taxable income in retirement, creates a safety net for policyholders to fall back on, and can help cover the ever increasing cost of tuiton. With this, in the event of passing, life insurance death benefit leaves behind a monetary love letter to clients families to allow them to grieve in a way they like without having to worry about finanicial obligations. 
Offering this product would put a great tool in the financial services giant with a trusted name backing the porduct and the framework of robo and human advisors already working for the company facing clients each day. The company already has the framework and the financial firepower to offer the product and the technological power to automate everything from applications to cliams. With fintech evolving so quickly, soon underwriting will no longer need to be a person at a desk, but instead a loop of financial code combing through data using a set of standards which can be designed to approve or decline a client dependent upon the risk they pose. 
Life insurance would be a great product for this company to offer because it would create a better overall experience for the client and would prevent clients from shopping out elsewhere for the product. With 99% of all term life insurance polcies never being paid out, Blackrock would profit greatly through collecting premiums and increasing the gap between them and their competitors in asset management.
